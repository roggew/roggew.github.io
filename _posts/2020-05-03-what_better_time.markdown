“*The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.  The second-best time is now*.”
						
						-Chinese Proverb

This quote is well-known. It’s actually used by Flatiron School in the marketing.  It’s a quote that is pretty common, but it is also a quote that holds a lot of value and truth.  It is a quote that has been resonating with me over the past year. 
It is not a coincidence that I have been referred to as a “Jack-of-all-trades” in my career up to now.  Throughout most of my life, I have always been pretty good at a lot of things.  Pretty good, reliable, not too bad kind of guy.  I have never really picked something though and said, “I’m going to focus on this one thing and learn it from the ground up”.  I have never tried to become a specialist in one thing and that is something that I want to change.  That change begins with software engineering.

Software Engineering is where innovation is happening.  From the Word app that I am using to write this draft, to the site where I finally publish this blog, none of it happens without coding.  With so much going to cloud based apps and mobile integration, coding is the backbone that makes sure that the user gets from point A to point B without any bumps in the road.  As I have read blogs, papers and looked on websites, I have really began to appreciate the process behind engineering.  

As I have grown, especially in the last couple of years, my perspective on the word “fail” has begun to change.  It is a word that a lot of people fear (I still struggle with that).  I am learning that when solid effort is applied and failure still happens, learning something is usually the outcome.  Through webinars, blogs and other research, I am learning that failure is not something to fear in software engineering.  Cod breaks all the time and that is ok.  Code can break (fail) and it is not a knock on who you are.  In fact, people all over are there to help you find the answer, not beat you for being a failure.   I like the thought of being able to look at a challenge and trying to and figure out the best way to meet that challenge.  I can get behind that kind of thinking.  This process of solving riddles and overcoming challenges with the environment that software engineering provides can lead you down some amazing paths.  

The paths of software engineers are vast.  From Fortune 500 to non-profits, to tech to finance to education to starting something on your own, there are so many avenues that open up to a good software engineer.  I have had several careers in my life so far.  Some have been very engaging.  Some have been a bit mind numbing.   I believe that developing the skills of a software engineer, along with the demand of those skills in the world will lead to something great.  What that is, I am not quite sure but what better time to find out!
